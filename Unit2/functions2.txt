functions2


Navigate to your Unit 2 folder in PyCharm


Create a file named functions2.py


Follow the directions below:


#Part 1:
# Create three global variables ‘x’, ‘y’ and ‘z’ and declare them with 
# an integer value of your choice


# Define three functions that will print a local variable with the 
# same name as the above variables and a different value


# Print the global variables ‘x’, ‘y’ and ‘z’ and call the three 
# functions you’ve just created


# Define three different functions (that require a parameter) to 
# change the global variable and print


# Print the global variables ‘x’, ‘y’ and ‘z’ again, and call the 
# three new functions you’ve just created, while commenting out the 
# previous three


#Part 2:
# Create four variables { name, verb, place, food } and set them as 
# empty strings


# Define four functions { updateName(), updateVerb(), updatePlace(), 
# updateFood() } that each take in one parameter and will update their 
# respective global variables


# Define a fifth function { myStory() } that will tell a story using 
# the updated global variables
