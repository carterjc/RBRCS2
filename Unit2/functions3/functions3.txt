functions3


Navigate to your folder in PyCharm named functions


Create a file named functions3.py


Follow the directions below:


# Part 1:
# Create a function ‘maxNum’ that takes in 3 integer arguments and 
# returns the maximum (store it in a variable to print)


# Create a function ‘sumAll’ that takes in 5 integer arguments and 
# returns the sum (store it in a variable to print)


# Create a function ‘longestWord’ that takes in three string arguments 
# and returns the longest { len() } (store it in a variable to print)




# Part 2:
# VOLUME OF A CYLINDER
# area of base x height
# (area = pi x r-squared)


# Create functions that will take in parameters, and print the volume 
# of a cylinder. You must use a return statement in at least one 
# function. Store your result in a variable and { cylAreaFunc(), 
# cylVolumeFunc() }


# Create similar functions for volume of a cube, sphere, & rectangle 
# prism




# BONUS
# Create a Calculator program that computes calculations for a user
# Create friendly input statements to aid the usage of your program
# Calculator program must include at least 10 computations
