dictionary1


Navigate to your DataStructures folder in PyCharm
Create a file named dictionary1.py


Complete the following:


# Part 1
# Create a dictionary ‘colorInt’ with ascending integers as keys 
# beginning at zero and five of your favorite colors as values


# Print this dictionary using a for loop (try using .format!())


# Create another dictionary ‘colorString’ with strings as keys, and 
# colors as values. The keys shall be the first letter of the color. 
# please stick to primary and secondary colors to avoid key confusion


# Print this dictionary using a for loop


# Part 2:
# Create a function ‘printDictionary’ that takes in a dictionary as a 
# parameter and prints it


# Print a value inside both dictionaries by searching for a key


# Print the length of both dictionaries


# Add three more colors to colorInt and print


# Delete one key/value pair of colorInt and print


# Change one of the values using .update()


# Part 3:
# Create a function that takes in two parameters (dictionary, 
# search_value)


# Print a formatted statement if the search_value is found inside the # dictionary or an error message if no result is found
