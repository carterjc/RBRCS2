dictionary3


Navigate to your DataStructures folder in PyCharm
Create a file named dictionary3.py




In dictionary3 we will create an application that will allow a user to ‘shop’ at a grocery store.  We will provide the program with grocery items & quantity and price for each item.  The user will be able to add items to a shopping cart, and check out with a grand total.


Complete the following:


# Create a dictionary ‘groceryStore’ that contains a dictionary of 5 
# items
# groceryStore keys will be numbers
# Dictionary items will have k/v pairs that include:
#         ‘itemName’: ‘apple’,
#         ‘itemPrice’: 6,
#         ‘itemQuant’: 10




# Create a variable ‘grandTotal’ to hold the value of each item as we # compile them into a shopping cart


# Create a list ‘shoppingCart’ that will store our items being 
# purchased


# Create a function ‘addToCart’ that will take in items we wish to add 
# to our cart. 


________________


# Complete all items from ONE option below (CHALLENGE YOURSELF!): 



# OPTION 3(DIFFICULT):
# This function must perform same operations as option 1 and 2
# This function must also check and see if the item we wish to buy 
# exists in the grocery store, giving an error message if it does not # exist

# OPTION 4(VERY DIFFICULT):
# This function must contain all previous options
# This function must also check and see if there is enough stock on 
# the item we wish to buy
# Provide an error message telling the user how many are available if # the amount requested exceeds the amount in stock

# ** ALL OPTIONS:
# Create a function ‘checkOut’ that creates a printed tally and total # price of our cart items


# BONUS
# Add the following functionality to checkOut:
# Provide a subtotal of each item instead of listing all items
#          Ex: apples x 4 @ $6 each
