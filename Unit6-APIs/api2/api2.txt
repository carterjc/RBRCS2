api2


- Create a project folder: Unit 6 APIs
- Create a file api2.py


Complete the following:


/*
 As a class, divide yourselves up into three groups
 INDIVIDUALLY work on three different parts of api2
 After ~27 min each “group” shall switch to another part
 to avoid the entire class working on the same API concurrently
 
 Each student should write their own code for each part!
 Helping your neighbor is encouraged, but this is not a group 
 assignment


 If any of the APIs take a while to load, wait 3 minutes and then try 
 again


 EG: 
Group A: 0min to 27min -> Part 1
Group B: 0min to 27min -> Part 2
Group C: 0min to 27min -> Part 3


Group A: 28min to 55min -> Part 2
Group B: 28min to 55min -> Part 3
Group C: 28min to 55min -> Part 1


Group A: 56min to 82min -> Part 3
Group B: 56min to 82min -> Part 1
Group C: 56min to 82min -> Part 2
