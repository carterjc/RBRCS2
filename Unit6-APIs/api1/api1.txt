api1


- Create a project folder: Unit 6 APIs
- Create a file api1.py
- Follow the instructions from [here] to import requests library


Complete the following:


# Part 1
# At the top of your file import requests, and json


# Using the example from the API Slides [link] create a request to 
# http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json


# Print the response


# Create a loop that will iterate over the response object only 
# printing its keys


# Create a loop that will iterate over the “people” array of the 
# response object and only print the “name” values

# Part 2
# Using this joke API create a program that will make a random joke 
# generator


# This program shall take user input to ask a user if they would like 
# to hear a joke


# Step 1: Read at the API documentation
# Step 2: Find the endpoint that will return one random joke, and test 
# in a browser window
# Step 3: Create an API call that will return a random joke
# Step 4: Test your code to see if you get the proper results
# Step 5: Extract the ‘setup’ and the ‘punchline’ from each joke
# Step 6: 
#        Create a loop that will prompt the user to hear a joke
#         If the user replies YES (or a positive response of your choice) 
#         display the setup, and after the user hits ENTER display the 
#        punchline
#        If the user replies NO (or a negative response of your choice) 
#         exit the program
#         All other inputs should print an error for invalid input




# BONUS 
# Create a joke class that will return a new joke using a method
# Allow the user three attempts to guess the punchline before it is 
# revealed
