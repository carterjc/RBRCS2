1 - The Mice once called a meeting to decide on a plan to free themselves of their enemy, the Cat.
2 - At least they wished to find some way of knowing when she was coming, so they might have time to run away.
3 - Indeed, something had to be done, for they lived in such constant fear of her claws that they hardly dared stir from their dens by night or day.
4 - Many plans were discussed, but none of them was thought good enough.
5 - At last a very young Mouse got up and said: "I have a plan that seems very simple, but I know it will be successful.
6 - All we have to do is to hang a bell about the Cat's neck.
7 - When we hear the bell ringing we will know immediately that our enemy is coming."
8 - All the Mice were much surprised that they had not thought of such a plan before.
9 - But in the midst of the rejoicing over their good fortune, an old Mouse arose and said: "I will say that the plan of the young Mouse is very good. But let me ask one question: Who will bell the Cat?"
