file1




- Create a project folder: Unit 5 FileIO
- Create file file1.py


Complete the following:
# Write a program that will create and update text files


# Part 1
# Create a variable ‘quote’ containing your favorite quote
# Here are some possible resources: [ Yoda Quotes, Shakespeare Quotes ]
# You may also use an API to find a quote [optional]
# Create a file object ‘write_file’ using open()
# Create a file ‘file1.txt’ and set the mode to write
# Using .write(), update ‘file1.txt’ with the contents of ‘quote’
# Close the file object using .close()




# Part 2
# Create a function read_file(f) that will read and print any file
# passed as an argument using open() 
# Don’t forget to close the file object
# Read and Print ‘file1.txt’ using read_file(f)




# Part 3
# Create a variable ‘quote2’ that contains another quote of your 
# choice
# Create a file object ‘append_file’ using the open() method, set the 
# file as file1.txt, set the mode to append 
# Write the quote2 data to append_file
# Close the file object
# Read the updated file using read_file(f)
# file1.txt should now have quote1 and quote2

# Part 4
# Create a function write2File(filename, stringObj) that takes in a 
# filename, and a string object, and will overwrite a file with the 
# content of the string object passed as an argument
# Create a variable ‘quote3’ that contains a third quote of your 
# choice
# Using write2File(fN, sO) create file file2.txt and supply quote3 
# as an argument        
# Use readFile(f) to read and print data




# Part 5
# Create a function append2File(filename, stringObj) that takes in a 
# filename, and a string object, that will append a file with the 
# content of the string object passed as an argument
# Create variable ‘quote4’ that contains a final quote of your choice
# Using append2File(fN, sO) append quote4 to file2.txt
# Use readFile(f) to read and print data
