tuple1


Navigate to your DataStructures folder in PyCharm


Create a file named tuple1.py


Complete the following:


# Part 1:
# A function ‘printObj( obj )’ that will print any list/tuple passed 
# as an argument


# A Tuple ‘numTuple’ that contains 4 numbers of your choice


# A Tuple ‘nameTuple’ that contains 4 names of your choice


# A list ‘numList’ that contains 4 numbers of your choice


# A list ‘nameList’ that contains 4 names of your choice


# Using printObj(), print your two Tuples


# Using printObj(), print your two Lists


# Create print statements identifying the index of the third item in 
# numTuple, nameTuple, numList and nameList


# Create print statements identifying the value of the second item in 
# numTuple, nameTuple, numList and nameList


# Create a statement that checks to see if your numTuple contains the # number 30, and print the result


# Create a statement that checks to see if your nameTuple contains 
# ‘Mike’ and print the result


# Create a statement that checks to see if your numList contains the 
# number 30 and print the result


# Create a statement that checks to see if your nameList contains your 
# name and print the result




#Part 2: 
# Create objects that will store two of your lists/tuples, but in  
# reverse. Print these objects using printObj()


# Create objects that will store the other two of your lists/tuples, 
# but sorted. Print these objects using printObj()


# Create a tuple with 10 random numbers in it, from 1-4 inclusive. 
# Using .count(), find out how many 3’s exist in this tuple, and print


# Turn nameTuple into a list newNameList using an abstract function


# Print newNameList reversed and sorted


BONUS I:
Create a function ‘tupleRemove(item, tuple)’ that will return a new tuple, with the item passed as a parameter removed an item from its tuple


BONUS II:
Create a tuple with 5 strings
Turn this tuple into a list, and print each value in the list reversed
